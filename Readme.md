# Predicting answer correctness of e-learners with a deep learning transformer model

This is my entry to the Kaggle challenge ["Riiid Answer Correctness
Prediction"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/riiid-test-answer-prediction/discussion/193250)

There are 4 distinct Kaggle kernels:

- `saint-plus/`: defines the transformer model,
- `saint-plus-preprocessing/`: preprocesses the data to put it into a hdf5
  format that will be fast to read when training the model,
- `saint-plus-train/`: trains the model, reading the data produced by the
  previous kernel
- `saint-plus-evaluate/`: evaluates the trained model 

Since these datasets use each other's outputs, they have to be properly imported
in the Kaggle interface (e.g. `saint-plus-train` must import
`saint-plus-preprocessing`). 

The kernels `saint-plus-train` and `saint-plus-evaluate` must import
`saint-plus` as a script.

Information about the test set in
https://www.kaggle.com/c/riiid-test-answer-prediction/data

    The API provides user interactions groups in the order in which they
    occurred. Each group will contain interactions from many different users,
    but no more than one task_container_id of questions from any single user.
    Each group has between 1 and 1000 users.

The test set has new users but no new questions.
